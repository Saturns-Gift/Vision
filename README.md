# Vision

Saturn's Gift will be a hardcore medieval top-down turn-based full-loot PVP & economy game where players can join together and compete to control territory. Each player will claim land for their personal linage and master their crafts to contribute to the economy of the world.

## PVP

PVP is a core pillar to Saturn's Gift. The systems of the game should reinforce the purpose of PVP such as location unique resources and reward players for participating in combat through loot & renown. Kingdoms should fight for control of the tiles.

## PVE

PVE is another pillar to Saturn's Gift. Items will naturally lose durability as you participate in PVP and also be dropped when killed for people to steal. Every item in the game will be crafted and require resources to create or cook. Animals need to be tended to and crops need to be harvested. There will lots to do! Each character has a skill tree that can be leveled similar to Runescape where you can max all of the professions in the game. There will be taming in the game as well to tame wild cows, horses, goats and chicken.

## Combat

Since Saturns Gift will be turn-based, combat will depend on character stats, weapon countering, item usage, positioning and a bit of RNG. Combat will be a big game of chess. An example is a cavalry will have an advantage over a sword & shield player but a spearman will have advantage over a cavalry. To win a siege against another kingdom you will need to bring a diverse set of characters. Guild officers should have special abilities such as pinging the world and telling their guild mates where to go as if they were playing an RTS.

## Linage

Each player will be able to have three characters that they can control for every turn. One character for combat and two characters for PVE. The combat character can also do PVE. The main point of multiple characters is to fill up the time between turns and to make the game feel more engaging given its turn-based nature.

## Land Claims

There are two types of land claims, guild claim and personal claims. A guild claim has three rings of which are all separated by castle walls. The inner ring is for the officers and guild leadership and is where the most valuable loot will be stored for the kingdom. The middle ring is where the high valuable players to the kingdom will be granted claim access and the outer ring is the public land where any player can claim on and join the guild. Personal claims can be claimed on guild land or in the wild. Claiming a personal claim in the wild offers no security of castle walls.

## Character NPCs

The primary resource of the game is players due to the players becoming NPCs when player are offline. The NPCs can do specific tasks that will be determined in the future. If a player goes inactive, the NPC disappears and the claim is released. The more active the account is, the more advanced actions the NPC can do which makes active players a desired resource.

## Feel

The game should feel like playing a persistent game of Civilization meets Rimworld meets Life is Fuedal.

## Art Style

The art style should be something that will age well but not overly complicated due to the perspective being topdown. The art style has to be something that catches people attention.

## Timeline

I can't really outline that as it depends on my motivation and life. I am trying to get a prototype out towards the end of 2021. If I come into any monetary resources, I will be funneling some of it into Saturns Gift and hopefully wth some luck, some people join the vision and help me build this game. It will be open source and MIT license so people can fork and use the foundation for another game of thier own. I just want this game to be made.

## Q&A

- Why full-loot?
  - The emotional risk of losing makes games fun and creates dynamic gameplay by nature of encouraging PVP
- Why turn-based?
  - I think turn based games can be fun if executed correctly and are easily scalable if this project gets any traction and allow the ability of a mobile port
- Why a browser game?
  - I think the browser is the best distribution network since the commitment to play is just a click of a button and with WebGL + WebAssembly, near native performance can be achieved.
- Why opensource?
  - I want this game for myself and since I am a single developer with a career, I hope to build a community of contributors. I also want to hopefully build a base for other creators to use to build ontop of.
- What happens to my claim if a guild is defeated?
  - Personal claims are not destroyed in seiges. You will have the option to stay with the new guild or go find a new guild. The choice is yours. 
- Cost?
  - The goal is to be free to play due to the need of players this game will require but this will change as the operation costs are known.
