## PVP

PVP is a core pillar to Saturns Gift. The systems of the game should reinforce the purpose of PVP such as location unique resources and reward players for partipating in combat through loot & renown. Kingdoms should fight for control of the tiles.

## PVE

PVE is another pillar to Saturns Gift. Items will naturally lose durabilty as you partipate in PVP and also be dropped when killed for people to steal. Every item in the game will be crafted and require resources to create or cook. Animals need to be tended to and crops need to be harvested. There will lots to do! Each character has a skill tree that can be levels similiar to Runescape where you can max all of the professions in the game. There will be taming in the game as well to tame wild cows, horses, goats and chicken.

## Combat

Since Saturns Gift will be turn-based, combat will depend on character stats, weapon countering, item usage, positioning and a bit of RNG. Combat will be a big game of chess. An example is a calvery will have an advantage over a sword & shield player but a spearman will have advantage over a calvery. To win a siege against another kingdom you will need to bring a diverse set of characters. Guild officers should have special abilities such as pinging the world and telling thier guild mates where to go as if they were playing an RPG.

## Linage

Each player will be able to have three characters that they can control for every turn. One character for combat and two characters for PVE. The combat character can also do PVE. The main point of multiple characters is to fill up the time seconds between turns and to make the game feel more engaging given its turn-based nature.

## Land Claims

There are two types of land claims, guild claim and personal claims. A guild claim has three rings of which are all seperated by castle walls. The inner ring is for the officers and guild leadership and is where the most valuable loot will be stored for the kingdom. The middle ring is where the high valuable players to the kingdom will be granted claim access and the outer ring is the public land where any player can claim on and join the guild. Personal claims can be claimed on guild land or in the wild. Claiming a personal claim in the wild offers no security of castle walls.

## Character NPCs

The primary resource of the game is players due to the players becoming NPCs when player are offline. The NPCs can do specific tasks that will be determined in the future. If a player goes inactive, the NPC dissapears and the claim is released. The more active the account is, the more advanced actions the NPC can do which makes active players a desired resource.

## Feel

The game should feel like playing a persistent game of Civilization meets Rimworld meets Life is Fuedal. 

## Art Style

To be determned.

## Timeline

I can't really outline that as it depends on my motivation and life. I am hoping to get a prototype out towards the end of 2021. If I come into any monetary resources, I will be funneling some of it into Saturns Gift and hopefully wth some luck, some people join the vision and help me build this game. It will open source and MIT license so people can fork and use the foundation for another game of thier own. I just want this game to be made.

## Q&A

- Why full-loot?
  - The emotional risk of losing makes games fun and creates dynamic gameplay by nature of encouraging PVP
- Why turn-based?
  - I think turn based games can be fun if executed correctly and are easily scalable if this project gets any traction and allow the ability of a mobile port
- Why a browser game?
  - I think the browser is the best distribution network since the commitment to play is just a click of a button and with WebGL + WebAssembly, near native performance can be achieved.
- Why opensource?
  - I want this game for myself and since I am a single developer with a career, I hope to build a community of contributors. I also want to hopefully build a base for other creators to use to build ontop of.
- What happens to my claim if a guild is defeated?
  - Personal claims are not destroyed in seiges and are saved to your account. You will have the option too stay with the new guild or go find a new guild. The choice is yours.
